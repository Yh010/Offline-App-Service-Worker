# Offline App Service Worker
 
Service workers are scripts that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, allowing them to perform tasks that don't require user interaction. They are an important part of modern web applications, providing capabilities such as caching, push notifications, background synchronization, and more. They enable offline access and enhanced performance for web applications.
